# rbtray-code

:TODO... Add same ability (right click) on task bar icon... Stupid Fuze!

A minor fork of RBTray from http://sourceforge.net/p/rbtray/code/

Version 4.4
The only change is to additionally allow minimizing a window using the shift key while right-clicking in the title bar, since some windows have custom minimize button controls that prevent the existing method from working.
